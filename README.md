# BarrierDetection-Classification

## Summary
Detection of news propagation barriers (economical, cultural,political, time zonal, and geographical) is still an open issue andrequire a standard approach that has yet to be found. We presenta benchmark task of barrier detection in news spreading by uti-lizing Wikipedia-concepts and meta data associated with eachbarrier. Solving this problem can not only convey the informationabout the coverage of an event but it can also show either anevent has been able to cross one of the barriers or not. Experimen-tal results on dataset "A dataset for information spreading overthe news (IPoNews)" reveals that simple classification modelsare able to classify barrier detection with high accuracy (wellabove 90%). We believe that our approach provides useful insightswhich pave the way for future development of system to predictabout information spreading barriers over news.
